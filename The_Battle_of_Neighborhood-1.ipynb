The restaurant ratings are numerical. Using classification techniques is also reasonable since the possible ratings are three discrete integers in this dataset. However, a three-class classification will likely predict too many ties and therefore prevent us from generating a top-n list of recommendations for a consumer. Rather than predicting the exact values of ratings that a consumer would give to certain restaurants, what is more important is predicting the ranks of these restaurants for the consumer. Thus, I will attempt to predict continuous values for the consumer ratings."
